Originally opened in 2006 and then expanded and fully remodeled in 2010, our Wedgwood store is as alive and vibrant as the Wedgwood neighborhood.  Located on 35th & 87th Ave NE, this store offers a warm and modern mid-century décor.  

JOIN US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE AND DELICIOUS CREPE!

We strongly believe in the power of community, an amazing cup of coffee and a delicious bite.  Café Javasti was founded with the purpose to bring these three things together.  Since 2001, we have been committed to serving high-quality coffee; pastries and savory items made from scratch daily; and a wide selection of made-to-order crepes with fresh, seasonal ingredients.   

We are proud to have anchored our business in North Seattle and grateful to the local neighborhoods who have supported us along the way.
