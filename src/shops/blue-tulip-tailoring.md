## Meet your Seamstress

Hi there!  I began sewing around the age of 6 taught by my grandmother and hand stiching by my mother.  In high school i made all my own dresses for dances and accessories goods for friends.  My professional career started when i was 22 managing the costume rental department at Champion Party Supply in Seattle.  Once I starting my family I took the position of alterations manager at David's Bridal.  After working with brides for 5 years I started with Diane's Alterations.  With now my lifetime of sewing skills I'm on my own path to offer the world.  I look forward to meeting you and helping you feel good in your clothes and comfortable in your home.
