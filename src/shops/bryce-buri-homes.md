## BRYCE BURI HOMES, REALTOR®️
### Real Estate Broker in Seattle, Washington making home dreams reality!

If you’re in the market to buy or sell a home, you’ve come to the right spot. Whatever your real estate needs, I can help you reach your goals with confidence. While visiting my website, you can access the most current real estate data and search for homes throughout the Western U.S. And when the time is right, feel free to contact me so that I can put the power of Windermere to work for you.

**Local Roots**

I am a born and raised Washingtonian originally from Gig Harbor. Currently living in the Wedgwood neighborhood in Northeast Seattle I have resided in Seattle proper since 1998.  I attended the University of Washington from 1998 to 2002 and graduated with a Business Administration degree.

**Community**

Being thoroughly involved in local affairs and the community are top priority to me.  Having three children I find it very important to be involved.  I am a volunteer at Wedgwood Elementary, coach basketball at Meadowbrook Community Center, and coach baseball through Northeast Seattle Little League (NESLL).  You will frequently see me with my loving and loud family dining out around the city, grabbing coffee at a local café, playing at a park with my kids, or adventuring to a new neighborhood.  Our very first-born, Bass (our yellow Labrador Retriever), rounds out our family and typically is barking from the upstairs window of our home saying “hi” to passers-by.
