We aim to provide classes, workshops, and other events geared to supporting people of all backgrounds and levels.

To welcome beginners to yoga, we have several Intro Series sessions to choose from. Continuing students can choose from the many drop-in classes each day, Levels I-III. They may also deepen their practice through Series, Workshops, our Seasonal Retreats, and Teacher Training. We offer group Hatha Yoga classes, Pre and Postnatal Yoga, Kids, & Tween Yoga, Yoga for 50+ and more at our neighborhood studios in the Capitol Hill, Phinney Ridge, and Wedgwood neighborhoods. We aim to foster yoga centers that meet the needs of the community and are always open to your suggestions.
