### It's Not Just Coffee To Us

Seattle is know for artisan coffeehouses and restaurants; you can get great coffee and food everywhere! That is what makes Seattle great! What sets us apart (besides great coffee and food) is our high dedication to customer service. Van Gogh Coffeehouse is a small, independent business with a working owner. Every employee is hand picked and trained by the proprietor to help ensure consistency and quality. Low staff turn over allows us to build relationships will many customers.

Drinks are hand crafted right in front of you. We proudly brew Zoka Coffee, a local artisan roaster specializing in family direct trade coffee.
Sandwiches are made to order with fresh ingredients. Try one of our delicious panini grilled on Honey Bear Bakery's parmesan foccocia bread!
