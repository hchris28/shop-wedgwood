We’re a creative grooming salon in Seattle, specializing in asian-style, teddy bear and show breed grooms. Our groomers are fear-free certified and we practice fear free and cooperative care grooming on every animal at our Cloudberry Pet Salon in Wedgwood.

We also offer pet photography and design, grooming and cooperative care classes for pet owners, and continuing education courses for groomers.

**Fear Free Grooming**
We’re 100% fear free - our groomers are certified, behaviorally educated and use cooperative care practices.

**Specialty Styles**
We specialize in asian fusion style grooming and breed cuts, backed by a decade in the dog show and competitive grooming world.

**Low volume Salon**
We groom straight through, so your pet doesn’t wait in a kennel all day. Sometimes we have snuffle mats or hang in the studio!
