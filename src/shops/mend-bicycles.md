(mend)bicycles believes the view is always better when sitting on a saddle, that beer is best after a long ride, that helmets are sexy, and that everyone is a cyclist, they just might not know it yet. We are committed to supporting all types of riders at all stages of their cycling adventure with professional service, carefully selected products, and an accepting, judgement free attitude.

James founded (mend) in 2014 to provide onsite service for Seattle Children's growing bike commuting community. He started working out of a his grandmother's old 1990 Honda Accord, working out of a tent. In the last four years, (mend) has expanded to include more community partners committed to supporting bicycle commuters, like Seattle Children's, and opened a neighborhood shop in Wedgwood in 2017.
