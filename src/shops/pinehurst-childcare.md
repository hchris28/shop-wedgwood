Pinehurst has been providing high quality child care to children and their families since 1982. In 2010, we joined Sound Child Care Solutions (SCCS), the first and only early learning, shared services consortium in Seattle, sharing administrative responsibilities so Center Directors can focus on culturally relevant programming and family communication. 

Pinehurst Child Care Center serves children between the ages of one month-five years of age. Located in the Wedgewood neighborhood of Seattle, we are a licensed, non-profit center. We work in partnership with families, recognizing that education first starts in the home.
