Grand Central Bakery ignited a bread revolution in 1989 by introducing rustic artisan loaves to Northwest tables. Values are at the heart of our company and sustainability touches everything we do – from where we buy ingredients to how we care for our employees and invest in our communities.

Our hand-crafted artisan breads and pastries are beloved locally and recognized nationally. Our bakery is considered one of 20 Great American Bread Bakeries (Saveur); acclaimed for having the best store-bought pie crust (Seattle Times); listed as one of Portland’s 5 Best Bakeries (Travel & Leisure); and ranked in the top cohort of the national Good Food 100 list for 2019.
