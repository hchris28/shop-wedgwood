VERACI SEATTLE

After many years of experimenting with gourmet focaccia bread and pizza at home, Marshall Jett and Errin Byrd decided to build a wood-fired clay oven on wheels and sell pizza at the Ballard Farmer’s Market.

​

The mission: Make the best pizza in the world.

​

Veraci Pizza was born on May 3, 2004 and things were never the same after that. Every Sunday brought more and more hungry fans - and when one customer wanted a pizza party at her house – Veraci catering was born.

​

In the years since, Veraci has grown to become one of Seattle most renowned and loved family businesses; building two popular brick-and-mortar pizzerias and offering private catering at events, weddings and more.

​

Thank you for all your support through the years.
