Located in the Wedgwood neighborhood of Seattle, we've been having fun serving area residents since 1992!

- We have the same friendly staff, the same great food, and the same diverse selection of beer on 18 taps—mostly from the Pacific Northwest’s world-renowned breweries
- We also feature a modest cocktail bar
- A few picnic tables outside welcome guests and their dogs
- There’s a café to bring in the kids with everything available from the upfront pub together with a kids’ menu
- Our back “speakeasy-style” room, complete with a beautiful 9’ Brunswick pool table and big-screen TVs, is perfect to rent for a party with your own personal server
- Expatriate archeologists and native squirrels are of course always welcome

The Wedgwood Ale House features three venues, each with its own entrance and restrooms.
