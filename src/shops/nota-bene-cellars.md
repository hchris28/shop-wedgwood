We are primarily red wine producers with a deep appreciation for most wines of the world. We specialize in Bordeaux and Rhône-style blends and vineyard designated wines but venture into white wine and rosé territory every other year or so. Striving to be boutique in size and artisan in manor, our winery is based in the South Seattle neighborhood of South Park, but our home and much of our work takes place in Wedgwood. We moved from Ravenna to Wedgwood in 1989 and have enjoyed our neighborhood home ever since.

We have now crafted 21 vintages in the same warehouse location in an ever-changing urban location. While the wines come to life in the city where our customer base thrives, we source all of our grapes in the beautiful vineyards of Eastern Washington. This is real beauty on a grand scale. The wines are made in a small scale, but with a community of assistants that are especially valued during harvest and bottling. Friends help friends make wine and friends share wine together. That’s why we think our wine is real because it’s made in a small way with a style that says it’s :Nota Bene. Year after year our wines can look and taste alike with our style yet expressing the real beauty of Washington State and the new vintage that’s unfolding. 

Please join us for a tasting at the winery usually on the 2nd Saturday of the month.

We offer free delivery to Wedgwood and the Seattle Metro area with orders of 3 + bottles.
