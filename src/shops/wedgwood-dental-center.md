At Wedgwood Dental Center (WDC) we believe in providing our patients with the best possible dental care in a comfortable and friendly setting. We are conveniently located in the Wedgwood neighborhood of Seattle, just north of the University of Washington and close to Laurelhurst, Ravenna, View Ridge, Sandpoint and Greenlake.

WDC is owned by Dr. Emily Shackelton. Dr. Shackelton has been in dentistry since 1989. After graduating from Eastern Washington University, she began her career in the dental field as a registered dental hygienist. She returned to dental school, attending Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to gain the skills needed to treat patients in all aspects of dental health and care.
