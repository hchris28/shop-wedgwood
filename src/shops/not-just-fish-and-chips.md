**Not Just Fish & Chips** was created during the 2020 Covid Pandemic. Chef/Owner Bruce Bowen has operated from this location for over 18 years, the past 15 providing hot lunch programs to private schools. Once it was clear the school lunch business was not returning anytime soon, Bruce decided to open a Creative Casual Seafood restaurant.

**Chef/Owner Bruce** is a lifelong Seattle resident. He went to Culinary School at South Seattle College in 1988. He spent the 1990's working at some of Seattle's best Seafood restaurants including Shuckers and The Georgian Room at The Four Seasons Olympic Hotel, Ponti Seafood Grill, Dukes Seafood and a few years at a popular Southwest restaurant, Rattlers Grill.

**We are Not Just Fish & Chips.** We are also  steamed clams, Seafood  and chicken sandwiches and salads. We bread our fish and chips with panko bread crumbs for a crispy, crunchy crust. 

**We do Take Out a little different.** Once your order is cooked, hot items are kept in warmers until you arrive for pick up. "Cold kits" come with most menu items. These cold kits contain sauces, dressings for salads,coleslaw, lettuce for sandwiches, everything packaged separate, on the side, so you can build your meal the way you like it and quality is maintained. We package our food in compostable containers.

**The Future.** As our business grows we will expand our menu with more tasty seafood dishes. We also plan on dine in seating when we are able to do so safely.
