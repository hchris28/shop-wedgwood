The Seattle Coin Shop was established in 1943 in downtown Seattle.  The current owner, John Drummey, purchased the business in 1995 and then relocated it to the Wedgwood neighborhood in northeast Seattle in 2000. Mr. Drummey is a Seattle native and has been a full-time professional numismatist since 1984. He is a member of the American Numismatic Association and the Pacific Northwest Numismatic Association, as well as an authorized dealer for both the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) and Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS).

The Seattle Coin Shop has a well-earned reputation for honest and reliable dealings in both buying and selling. Our prices are nationally competitive and we can handle large transactions professionally and confidentially.
