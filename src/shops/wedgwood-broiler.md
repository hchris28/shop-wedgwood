### Restaurant & Lounge

Our family dining room offers those throwback booths and comfort from another era. Serving choice steaks by the ounce and the same hand crafted cocktails from our lounge but in a more kid friendly environment sure to bring back memories and create new ones. We are able to accommodate a wide variety of groups and offer a half price children’s menu every Sunday. On Saturday and Sunday stop in for the neighborhoods best kept secret, our breakfast served from 8:00am – 1:45pm.

Take a step back into the 1960’s in our retro cocktail lounge. Hand-poured drinks and our famous house martinis and manhattans are sure to hit the spot.

Our famous happy hour is offered Saturday – Thursday from 4:00pm – 6:00pm and 9:00pm – close.
