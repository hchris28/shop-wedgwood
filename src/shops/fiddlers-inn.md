We have fantastic pizza as well as our signature sandwiches. Stop by our online menu regularly to follow our latest offerings. We will continue to feature amazing beer from our brewer friends and occasionally entertain you with a virtual brewer event. Beer to go can be ordered online as well and we can fill your growler, or you can purchase one here at the Fid.
