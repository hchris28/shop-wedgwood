**Blue Poppy Floral and Gifts** specializes in floral arrangements for the home, events, and special occasions.  We also have a vast array of house plants, including orchids, kokedama, air plants, tropical, terrarium bar/succulents, and a wide variety of unique gifts and treats for people and pooches. It has long been a dream of mine to have a space where I can share my passion for all things floral with our community, a place for neighbors to gather, and welcome those new to Wedgwood.  Please come by the shop and say “hello” I'd love to meet you!
